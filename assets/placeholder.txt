This directory will contain:
- icon.png (application icon)
- Inter-Regular.ttf (modern font)
- Other UI assets

For now, these are placeholders. In a real implementation, you would:
1. Add a proper application icon (icon.png)
2. Download and include the Inter font or use system fonts
3. Add any other required assets like sound files, images, etc.
